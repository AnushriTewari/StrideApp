1.) //lock the app so that it doesn't rotate... currently when it rotates, it looks pretty bad
2.) Why are static styles being used and not a style component with references to it? Wouldn't it be best practice to use style sheets or components?
3.) //On the iphone version, it does not comply with the "safe areas" for ios11 for the iphoneX. You want to avoid the notch at the top of the phone
4.) //The reset your password page has "reset.your.password" it should be "reset your password"
5.) The code is written as though the data will always be there. When are you planning on working on the services that will provide hard coded data? Part of the project is to identify the necessary data contracts so that the back end developer has something to work from.


 //I am unable to swipe through the intro screens; 
 //Second screen has "with" misspelled as "width"; 
 //There are no dots at the bottom of each intro screen indicating where you are in the multi-page intro
 //It looks like only the "Next" text is clickable to move from screen to screen, the entire bottom area should be a button to move to the next intro screen

 //The dots to indicate which screen of the dashboard you are on are blue.  They should be gray or empty
 //The navigation arrows to the left and right of the progress circle are missing
Missing data for "raised" - not critical
 //On the android version, the icon for leaderboard is very small compared to the other icons

I don't see this screen.  How do I get to it?
